# How to Predict a hit song - Our project aims to uncover the key qualities that contribute to a song's popularity on music streaming platforms by analyzing data from over 1000 top-streamed songs in 2023. Using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost, we investigate the relationships between various musical attributes (like bpm, danceability, and valence) and stream counts. This analysis helps us identify the factors that make songs hits, providing valuable insights for artists and the music industry to enhance their strategies for creating and promoting music that resonates with a broad audience. Through our findings, we aim to support new artists, foster innovation, and ensure that music continues to play a vital role in our lives.
